## Overview
Here we provide the implementation of a Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer in TensorFlow, along with a minimal execution example (on the Cora dataset). The repository is organised as follows:
- `data/` contains the necessary dataset files for Cora;
- `models/` contains the implementation of the GAT network (`gat.py`);
- `pre_trained/` contains a pre-trained Cora model (achieving 84.4% accuracy on the test set);
- `utils/` contains:
    * an implementation of an attention head, along with an experimental sparse version (`layers.py`);
    * preprocessing subroutines (`process.py`);
    * preprocessing utilities for the PPI benchmark (`process_ppi.py`).

Finally, `execute_cora.py` puts all of the above together and may be used to execute a full training run on Cora.
